# DistanceSampler
Heuristic modification of the Heun sampler using normalized distances.

No readme yet but you can try already.

Work better with little amounts of steps. Starting at 4, recommanded 10.

Using AYS/AYS30/Simple/Karras for the schedulers.

Includes a "Heun CFG++" using the [alternative Euler CFGpp version found ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/7df42b9a2364bae6822fbd9e9fa10cea2e319ba3/comfy_extras/nodes_advanced_samplers.py) slapped with the Euler part at the end.

The node has a bit of explainations in the tooltips.
